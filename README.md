## Backend Programming Test Using Nestjs

#### Scenario
You intend to create card games like Poker and Blackjack. The goal is to create an API to handle decks and cards to be used in any game like
these.
#### Instructions
You are required to provide an implementation of REST API to simulate a deck of cards.
You need to provide a solution written in NodeJS Typescript . If you do not feel too comfortable with the language, it is OK to research a little
before starting writing the API. Feel free to use any NodeJS Typescript framework in the market or simply use a custom build.
The API should have the following methods to handle cards and decks:

* Create a new Deck
* Open a Deck
* Draw a Card
